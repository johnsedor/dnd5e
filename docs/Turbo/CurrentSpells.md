+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 120 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
+ Duration: 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

> Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything Evocation cantrip

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 60 feet
+ Components: V, S
+ Duration: Instantaneous

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## [Tenser's Floating Disk](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tensers-floating-disk#:~:text=This%20spell%20creates%20a%20circular,hold%20up%20to%20500%20pounds.)
> Source: Player's Handbook
1st-level conjuration (ritual)

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 30 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
+ Duration: 1 hour

> This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes, and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it were created at the bottom.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

## [Armor of Agathys](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:armor-of-agathys)
> Source: Player's Handbook 1st-level abjuration

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: Self
+ Components: V, S, M (a cup of water)
+ Duration: 1 hour

> A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot.

## [Shield of Faith](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shield-of-faith)

+ Casting Time: 1 bonus action
+ Range: 60 feet
