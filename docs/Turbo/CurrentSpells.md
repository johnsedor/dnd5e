+ Range: 120 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
+ Duration: 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

> Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything Evocation cantrip

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 60 feet
+ Components: V, S
+ Duration: Instantaneous

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
At Higher Levels. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

> Source: Player's Handbook Conjuration cantrip

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 30 feet
+ Components: V, S
+ Duration: 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

# Spells 1st Level
## [Tenser's Floating Disk](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tensers-floating-disk#:~:text=This%20spell%20creates%20a%20circular,hold%20up%20to%20500%20pounds.)

1st-level conjuration (ritual)

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 30 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
+ Duration: 1 hour

> This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes, and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it were created at the bottom.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

+ Casting Time: 1 minute
+ Range: Touch
+ Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
+ Duration: Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

## [Sanctuary](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sanctuary)
> Source: Player's Handbook 1st-level abjuration

+ Casting Time: 1 bonus action
+ Range: 30 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
+ Duration: 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.

+ Range: Touch
+ Components: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)
+ Duration: Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.
You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.
