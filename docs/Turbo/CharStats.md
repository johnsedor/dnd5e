- Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 2.
- Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
- Alignment. Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.
- Size. Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.
- Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

# Spells
## [Tenser's Floating Disk](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tensers-floating-disk#:~:text=This%20spell%20creates%20a%20circular,hold%20up%20to%20500%20pounds.) 
> Source: Player's Handbook
1st-level conjuration (ritual)

+ Casting Time: 1 action
+ Range: 30 feet
+ Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
+ Duration: 1 hour

> This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes, and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it were created at the bottom.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.
