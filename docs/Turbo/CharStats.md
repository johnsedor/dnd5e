- Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.

- Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

# Primary Class - [The Artificer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer)
## Class Features
As an artificer, you gain the following class features.

## Hit Points
+ Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level
+ Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
+ Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

## Proficiencies
+ Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
+ Weapons: Simple weapons
+ Tools: Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice
+ Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence
+ Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand

## Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

any two simple weapons
a light crossbow and 20 bolts
(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail
thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack
Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency
The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

## Magical Tinkering
At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

# Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.
After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

## Spellcasting
You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

## Cantrips (0-Level Spells)
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer can trips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.
When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

## Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

## Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
+ Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
+ Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

## Infuse Item
At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

## Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

## Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.
You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.
If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

## The Right Tool for the Job
At 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Tool Expertise
At 6th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

## Flash of Genius
At 7th level, you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. 
When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Magic Item Adept
When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:
You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

## Spell-Storing Item
At 11th level, you can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a lst- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).
While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

## Magic Item Savant
At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:
You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
You ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

## Magic Item Master
Starting at 18th level, you can attune up to six magic items at once.

## Soul of Artifice
At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:
+ You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
+ If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

# Secondary Class - [Forge Adept](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:forge-adept)
## Tool Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith’s tools. 
If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

## Forge Adept Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Forge Adept Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

## Forge Adept Spells
### Artificer Level	Forge Adept Spells
+ 3rd	[Armor of Agathys](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:armor-of-agathys), [Shield of Faith](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shield-of-faith)
+ 5th	[Spiritual Weapon](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:spiritual-weapon), [Warding Bond](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:Warding-bond)
+ 9th	[Beacon of Hope](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:beacon-of-hope), [Remove Curse](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse)
+ 13th	[Death Ward](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:death-ward), [Fire Shield](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fire-shield)
+ 17th	[Banishing Smite](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishing-smite), [Wall of Force](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-force)

## Battle Ready
Beginning at 3rd level, you’re skilled in fighting side-by-side with your companions on the field of battle. 
+ You gain proficiency with martial weapons. 
+ Additionally, when you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

## Ghall'Shaarat
At 3rd level, you learn to imbue a weapon with a fraction of your spirit. The Dhakaani daashors called this weapon the ghaal’shaarat, Goblin for “mighty blade.” Imbuing your ghaal’shaarat works like infusing an item, but does not count toward your maximum number of infused items. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a magic or nonmagical simple or martial melee weapon, which becomes your ghaal’shaarat.
Once imbued, your ghaal’shaarat is a magic weapon that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless the base weapon you imbued already grants a higher bonus. This bonus increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to +2 at 8th level and +3 at 13th level. If the weapon you imbued has the thrown property, it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
Your ghaal’shaarat’s benefits remain until the weapon is destroyed or until you use this ability to imbue a new item with this power. Other creatures can’t benefit from your ghaal’shaarat’s powers, and to them, it functions as the unimbued weapon did.

## Extra Attack
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Runes of War
At 9th level, you gain the ability to enhance the weapons of your squad, targeting the damage to the weakness of your enemies. As an action, you can activate an aura that extends from you in a 30-foot radius. The aura moves with you, centered on you, and lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were casting a spell).
When you activate this aura, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Each creature of your choice in the aura deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits with a weapon attack.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.

# Perfect Weapon
At 15th level, you learn how to imbue your ghaal’shaarat with additional power, and how to draw on it in time of need. The first time you attack with your ghaal’shaarat on your turn, you can transfer some or all of its bonus to your armor class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For every 1 you reduce your attack and damage rolls by, you gain +1 to your AC. As long as you continue holding your ghaal’shaarat, the AC bonus remains in effect until the start of your next turn.
Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can select one of the following benefits. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain the selected benefit whenever you’re holding your ghaal’shaarat.
You have resistance to psychic damage, and you can’t be charmed or frightened.
You use your ghaal’shaarat to channel the elements. When you select this ability, select one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you hit with your ghaal’shaarat, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type.
